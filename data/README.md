This folder contains all the data generated by the data prep notebook (data_prep.ipynb) that is used for model training, inference and trading simulation.

The structure is to have subfolders for each type of market data and csv files for each time interval within them. For example subfolders market_context and stocks will exist in data and within data/stocks will be files 1d.csv, 1h.csv etc for 1 day and 1 hour historical data
